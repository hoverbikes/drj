<header><h1>Phi-square Competition Database (Phi-CD)</h1>
<h3>An online tool for quantifying<br>auditory and visual lexical competition</h3><hr></header>
<p>When a speaker utters a word, the listener is tasked with matching that acoustic-phonetic input to a lexical item stored in memory. Given the size of the mental lexicon and the speed with which speech occurs, spoken word recognition is a feat of human cognition. Although models of spoken word recognition differ in the details of how it is achieved, there is general consensus about at least two features of the process: input simultaneously activates multiple lexical items in memory, and these items compete for recognition (see <a href="http://www.mpi.nl/publications/escidoc-1169572/">Weber & Scharenborg, 2012</a> for a recent review). This database contains multiple metrics for quantifying the process of lexical competition during auditory and visual (lipread) spoken word recognition.</p>
<p>A manuscript detailing how each metric is quantified is currently under review and will be posted here when available.
