<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When a speaker utters a word, the listener is tasked with matching that acoustic-phonetic input to a lexical item stored in memory. Given the size of the mental lexicon and the speed with which speech occurs, spoken word recognition is a remarkable feat of human cognition. Although models of spoken word recognition differ in the details of how it is achieved, there is general consensus about at least two features of the process: input simultaneously activates multiple lexical items in memory, and these items compete for recognition (see <a href="http://www.mpi.nl/publications/escidoc-1169572/">Weber & Scharenborg, 2012</a> for a recent review). This database contains multiple metrics for quantifying the process of lexical competition during auditory and visual (lipread) spoken word recognition.</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Enter the orthographic form of the word or words for which you wish to generate data. Multiple words may be entered at once, separated either by commas, spaces, or line breaks. Below, select the values you would like to generate, either by selecting individual measures (<em>e.g.</em>, v_lec) or classes of measures (<em>e.g.</em>, all visual categorical measures). The output will be displayed as a table below. Hover over each abbreviation to see its definition, or <%= link_to 'view the glossary', '/phi-lex_glossary' %>.</p>
